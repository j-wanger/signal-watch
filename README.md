# Signal Watch — AML Vision Demo

A presenter-driven, offline, browser-based **vision prototype** for AML stakeholder
buy-in. It is a scripted, reliable dramatization of a signal/atom monitoring loop —
**not** a working detection system. Every figure shown is illustrative and labelled
as such.

The walkthrough, in six acts:

> read a regulatory advisory → extract candidate signals → assess coverage against
> our library + data → **human selects** what to build → agent drafts a signal
> definition → **human confirms** → backtest → reveal **combination lift** →
> coverage closes → loop repeats.

The persuasion lives in two human-in-the-loop gates (trust) and the combination-lift
reveal (why composed atoms beat monolithic scenarios).

## Run it

Build a typology to a single self-contained file, then open it (no server, no deps
except a Google Fonts `<link>` when online):

```
python3 scripts/build.py fentanyl                     # -> dist/fentanyl/index.html
python3 scripts/build.py trade-based                  # -> dist/trade-based/index.html
python3 scripts/build.py elder-financial-exploitation # -> dist/elder-financial-exploitation/index.html
python3 scripts/build.py all                          # build every typology
python3 scripts/build.py --check all                  # drift guard: committed dist == fresh build?

open dist/fentanyl/index.html                         # macOS — or just double-click it
```

`--check` re-renders every config in memory and byte-compares it against the committed
`dist/<id>/index.html` (non-mutating); it exits non-zero and names the typology if any built
file has drifted from its source. Run it before committing or presenting.

The built file runs offline from `file://`. Fonts fall back to system serif/sans/mono
if offline. Content lives in `config/typologies/*.json`; the engine (`index.html`) is
generic and never carries typology copy.

## Add a typology

1. Copy an existing `config/typologies/<id>.json`, edit it against `config/schema.md`
   (advisory text **public-source and paraphrased** by default; for a **FinCEN** advisory you may
   inline the **verbatim** public-domain text via `advisory_full`, attributed; figures illustrative).
2. `python3 scripts/build.py <id>` — the build validates the config against the schema
   and fails loud on any violation, then writes `dist/<id>/index.html`.

No engine edits required.

## Present it

- Build the typology you want and open `dist/<id>/index.html` in the presentation browser,
  fullscreen. To switch typologies on stage, open the other built file.
- Drive it with the on-screen **Back / Next** buttons, or the **keyboard**: **→ / Space**
  advance, **←** goes back, **Esc** (or the on-screen **↺**) resets to a clean Act 0. The
  stepper rail at the top is clickable to jump to any act already reached.
- **Act 3** (Human review) requires you to select at least one candidate before Next
  enables — this is the first human gate. **Act 4** (Agent builds) waits on your
  confirm — the second gate. Don't skip these; they are the point. The gates hold under
  the keyboard too — advancing past them without selecting / confirming does nothing.
- The final act loops back to the start (**Run again ↺**) for a clean reset between runs.
- Honors **`prefers-reduced-motion`**: with the OS "reduce motion" setting on, every act
  lands in its final state with no animation. (A speaker-notes overlay is not built.)

## Compliance

- No real customer, account, or transaction data — anywhere. Coverage, population, and
  precision numbers are synthetic and illustrative.
- The only real-world content is **public advisory material** — paraphrased by default, per typology:
  - **fentanyl** — FINTRAC Operational Alert on illicit synthetic opioids (Jan 2025).
  - **trade-based** — FinCEN Alert on fentanyl-linked trade-based laundering (Apr 2025);
    FATF report on TBML trends & developments (2024).
  - **elder financial exploitation** — FinCEN Advisory EFE FIN-2022-A002, reproduced **verbatim**
    (US federal advisories are public domain, 17 USC §105; attributed, kept visually separate from
    the illustrative badge). The verbatim exception is FinCEN-only — it does not extend to FINTRAC.
- The "Illustrative data & outputs" badge stays visible at all times — it is a trust
  device for a compliance audience, not a disclaimer to hide.

- `CLAUDE.md` — always-loaded project memory / non-negotiables for the agent.

## Status

**M6 — Signal Watch ingestion pipeline.** Config-driven engine (M1) + three typologies
(**fentanyl**, **trade-based ML** — M2; **elder financial exploitation** — M6), switchable at build
time with no engine edits, plus presenter polish (M3: keyboard nav, reset, `prefers-reduced-motion`).
M6 added a build-time authoring pipeline (acquire a FinCEN advisory PDF → convert to markdown →
hand-derive a signal) and renders the FULL verbatim EFE advisory (FinCEN FIN-2022-A002, public
domain) in Act 1. Runs offline from a single `file://` artifact per typology. Live / pre-generated
mode (M4) is intentionally not built — scripted is the ship path. See `HANDOFF.md §8` for the
milestone plan.
